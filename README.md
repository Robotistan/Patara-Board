# Patara Board

Patara Board is an electronic board that helps us control computers using objects we use in our daily life.
It is based on Raspberry Pi, but it is very easy to use.
When it is connected to a computer with a USB cable, the computer recognizes it like a keyboard or a mouse.

Patara makes coding, electronics, and creativity fun.
It lets you build your own controllers instead of using a keyboard.
With its interactive activities, it helps improve motor skills.
Patara helps children and beginners love engineering and the maker world.

On Patara’s arms, there are:
Direction buttons (↑, ↓, ←, →),
Space / Enter,
Mouse buttons: Click (left) and Right Click,
and two GND buttons.
To use these buttons, alligator clip cables are attached.
The GND connection must always be used to complete the circuit.

On the board, there is a 5×5 LED matrix,
a touch-controlled piano that can be played whenever you want,
X–Y function buttons,
and direction buttons

At the bottom, there are
pin inputs for mouse direction control,
multiple GND pins,
and jumper cable pin connections to control the WASD keys.
